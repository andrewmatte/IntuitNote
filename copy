Project ADE (Apprentice Data Extractor) is Software as a Service for people who work extract data from texts.
Not only can you tag and extract sentences with tags, we will also suggest new tags for you based on prior tags.

Our Freemium model means you can try for free now, then pay only if you decide you like it.
Sign up, create subjects, insert documents, tag sentences, and please let us know what you think.
